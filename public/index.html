                    <p>Jeevan, he was proud of the fact that he didn't let out the split of Arthur and Elizabeth until 24 hours had passed since their interview. He remembered his past life as a paparazzo with one guilt-laden moment when he had clicked an unflattering photo of Arthur's first wife. In the wintery city, those memories were strange to him.</p>

                    <p>Jeevan and Frank hole up in their apartment, where society has fallen apart-sealing off the space, avoiding contact with people. As the news grows worse and the cities go dark, Frank works on a memoir while Jeevan ruminates on the brittleness of civilization. Thin supplies and dead lights bring normalcy into Jeevan's hopes but Frank doubts him.</p>

                    <p>On the fifty-eighth day, Jeevan asked Frank to read about what a philanthropist had to say about celebrity charity. Frank mentioned how actors primarily wanted to be famous and not because of altruism, then reflected on how immortality through film and the need to be remembered can work.</p>
