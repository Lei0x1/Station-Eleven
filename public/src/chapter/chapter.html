                        <p>On the night King Lear opens at the Elgin Theatre, Arthur Leander collapses in a heap halfway through the show. Jeevan, an audience member and paramedic in training, leaps onto the stage to try and save him. He starts CPR with the help of a cardiologist in the audience, but Arthur cannot be revived. </p>
                        <p>Jeevan comforts the young girl Kirsten and makes a resolution that he has to find her guardian. Closing the door, he feels guilt at having survived. On his way home, though in snow, he comes to a realization that he wants to be a paramedic.</p>
