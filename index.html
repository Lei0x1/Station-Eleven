            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In Act 4 of King Lear at the Elgin Theatre, actor Arthur Leander collapses on stage. Audience member Jeevan, a trainee paramedic, rushes to help him. He starts CPR with a cardiologist, but Arthur can’t be revived.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Jeevan comforts a young girl named Kirsten and decides to find her guardian. As he leaves, he feels guilty for surviving. Walking home in the snow, he realizes he wants to be a paramedic.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>At the Elgin Theatre, only a few people were left. A woman washed costumes, a man ironed, and an actress drank tequila. A stagehand mopped the floor, while a caregiver comforted a crying child.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In the lobby, they talked about Arthur’s family. They learned he had a son named Tyler in Israel and several ex-wives. They decided to call his lawyer about his death.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>They raised their glasses to Arthur before leaving into the snow. In the dressing room, Tanya gave Kirsten a paperweight with a storm cloud inside. The bartender was the last to leave and died three weeks later.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Jeevan walked in Allan Gardens, feeling the warmth of the greenhouse while snow fell outside. He admired the plants and thought about visiting his brother Frank to share the news of Arthur’s death.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>After leaving, he took a streetcar home, remembering Arthur and his friend Hua, who warned him about the Georgia Flu spreading fast.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Worried, Jeevan decided to leave the city. He rushed to a grocery store for supplies and tried to call his girlfriend, Laura, but she dismissed his fears. He urged her to leave before it was too late.</p>
