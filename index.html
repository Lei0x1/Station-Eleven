            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>On the night King Lear opens at the Elgin Theatre, Arthur Leander collapses in a heap halfway through the show. Jeevan, an audience member and paramedic in training, leaps onto the stage to try and save him. He starts CPR with the help of a cardiologist in the audience, but Arthur cannot be revived.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Jeevan comforts the young girl Kirsten and makes a resolution that he has to find her guardian. Closing the door, he feels guilt at having survived. On his way home, though in snow, he comes to a realization that he wants to be a paramedic.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>At the Elgin Theatre, only a few were remaining behind. The woman was washing costumes, the man was doing some ironing, the actress was drinking tequila, the stagehand was mopping up the floor, while the caregiver was pacifying a whimpering child.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>About Arthur's family, they talked in the lobby, finding out he had a son in Israel by the name of Tyler and several ex-wives. They decided to call his lawyer to cover his death.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>They toasted to the absent Arthur and then disappeared into the snow. Backstage, Tanya gave Kirsten a glass paperweight with a storm cloud inside it. The bartender was the last one to leave and died three weeks later.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Jeevan walked around Allan Gardens in the hot house while the snow fell outside. He admired the plants and considered visiting his brother Frank to talk over the death of Arthur.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>After leaving, he took a streetcar home, remembering Arthur and his friend Hua, who warned him about the Georgia Flu spreading fast.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Afraid for his life, Jeevan flees town. He stops at an ramen/grocery store to load up on supplies, and also tries calling Laura, his girlfriend, to warn her; she thinks he is overreacting. "You really ought to get out before it's too late," he said.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>The only ones present in the Elgin Theatre that night were the security guard and the producer, who promptly called Arthur's lawyer with the news of his death. The latter spent two hours going over Arthur's will and promptly called Arthur's close friend at dawn, who in turn called Arthur's ex-wives that morning.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Working in Malaysia, Miranda received news that Arthur, the love of her life, died of a heart attack on stage during a play. It comes so ordinarily, leaving her to sort through the loss, to remember the truth that life goes on. Alone, she looks out at the ships far off, their lights illuminating across the waterways.</p>

                    <p>Everything from everyday objects is lost. There's no swimming, no night games, no cities. Movies and concerts are extremely seldom; medicines are non-existent. There's limited air travel; planes are used for storage. There are no more borders, no more emergency services. The internet's gone, so people cannot connect through the internet anymore.</p>
